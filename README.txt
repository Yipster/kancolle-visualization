CPSC 583 Project 2.3

Kancolle Visualization
by Brandon Yip
------------------------

For this release, the visualization DOES NOT WORK ON CHROME. 
I REPEAT, AT THIS MOMENT IT HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED ON FIREFOX.

Otherwise, just open up in Firefox and have fun.

There are some bugs though.


Found Bugs
------------------
- The grey lines sometimes don't show up or don't move when rearranging axis.
- When searching a ship, it only gives one color.
- Other bugs not found yet


Features to be implemented in a future iteration
------------------------------------------------
- Autocomplete in search bar
- Improved UI
- When looking at one ship, adding axis will refresh the entire page. This will be changed
- Comparing two ships.
